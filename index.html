    I remember Misha's Wedding the day I saw you in saree in person and you were looking so damn gorgeous  
    and I have always been so proud to have you serve you protect you take care of your small things.  
    I remember when you came in the parking and hugged me with tears in your eyes.  
    I miss the version where you cared for me where I was heard and yes it is all my fault losing it all in just a moment.  
    I am sorry Krishna but I promise you that I am never leaving your side and make a relationship that everyone craves for.

    You and your those beautiful eyes  
    The way we look at each other when we are in person it is not forced it feels so natural  
    that I cannot stop looking at you admiring you and tell you how much I love you.  
    That talk with that camping guy making you smile and getting to know new things  
    it feels so good and feels like an achievement to me.  
    I apologise for the times I have made you cry and there were tears in your eyes  
    I will make up for every hurt I caused you.

    If you would ask me that what is that one thing I would be desperate to heal in you  
    it will be the wounds that have been there since life.  
    I know that you are so strong and the situations you have been through  
    have made you the strongest but I also know there is that little girl  
    who wants to be loved and cared for.  
    I know I have not been the one yet but I have started doing it  
    and I will heal you in every way possible  
    and you will be healthy again happy again and without tears for life.
