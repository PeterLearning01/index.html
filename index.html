    I remember when we visited this sunset spot  
    and saw couples getting the photoshoot done  
    I imagined us being there one day  
    My happiness resides in you  
    Every sunset every sunrise tere saath dekhna hai  

    Samundar kabhi nadi se aankh nahi ladta  
    meri himmat to dekho main ek boond hoon  
    aur samundar ke sehlab se aankh lada baitha hoon  
    ek boond hi sahi  
    tere liye sehlab ban jaunga  
    bas tujhe apna aur khud ko tera  
    bana kar hi mar jaunga

    If you would ask me what is that one thing  
    I would be desperate to heal in you  
    it would be the wounds that have been there since life  
    I know you are strong  
    and the situations you have been through  
    have made you the strongest  
    but I also know there is that little girl  
    who wants to be loved and cared for  
    I know I have not been the one yet  
    but I have started  
    I will heal you in every way possible  
    and you will be healthy again  
    happy again  
    and without tears for life

    I remember Misha's Wedding the day I saw you in saree in person  
    and you were looking so damn gorgeous  
    I have always been so proud to have you  
    serve you protect you take care of your small things  
    I remember when you came in the parking  
    and hugged me with tears in your eyes  
    I miss the version where you cared for me  
    where I was heard  
    and yes it is all my fault losing it all in just a moment  
    I am sorry Krishna  
    but I promise I am never leaving your side  
    and make a relationship that everyone craves for

    You and your those beautiful eyes  
    The way we look at each other when we are in person  
    it is not forced it feels so natural  
    I cannot stop looking at you admiring you  
    and telling you how much I love you  
    That talk with that camping guy  
    making you smile and getting to know new things  
    feels so good and feels like an achievement to me  
    I apologise for the times I made you cry  
    I will make up for every hurt I caused you
