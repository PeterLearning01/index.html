    I remember when we visited this sunset spot  
    and saw couples getting photoshoots done  
    I imagined us there one day  
    My happiness resides in you  
    Har sunset har sunrise tere saath dekhna hai  
    Samundar kabhi nadi se aankh nahi ladta  
    main ek boond hoon  
    Ek boond hi sahi tere liye sehlab ban jaunga

    I remember Misha's Wedding the day i saw you in saree in person and you were looking so damn gorgeous and i have always been so proud to have you, serve you, protect you, take care of your small things. I remeber when you came in the parking and hugged me with tears in your eyes. i miss the version where you cared for me, where i was heard and yes it is all my fault losing it all in just a moment. I am sorry Krishna, but i promise you that i am never leaving your side and make a relationship that everyone craves for.
