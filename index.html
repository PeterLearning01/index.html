      Hey Krishnaba Gohil  
      the coolest woman I ever met in my life  

      The baddie  
      the sweetest  
      the kindest  
      the lovable  
      the charming  
      the adorable  

      You and those Pavagadh mountains  
      are such a bliss in my life  

      As they say  
      you complete my life  
      and I need you for my life  

      I sincerely apologize  
      for the hurt I have caused  

      Bharosha rakh mujh par  
      tujhe kabhi hurt nahi karunga ab  

      I will make you the queen  
      of my entire life  

      You are my inspiration

      I remember when we visited this sunset spot  
      and we saw couples getting photoshoots done  

      I was imagining us being there one day  
      and I would be the happiest person alive  

      My happiness resides in you  

      Every sunset  
      every sunrise  
      tere saath dekhna hai  

      Samundar kabhi nadi se aankh nahi ladta  

      Meri himmat dekho  
      main ek boond hoon  

      Aur samundar ke sehlab se  
      aankh lada baitha hoon  

      Ek boond hi sahi  
      tere liye sehlab ban jaunga  

      Bas tujhe apna  
      aur khud ko tera  
      bana kar hi mar jaunga

      I remember Misha’s wedding  
      the day I saw you in a saree  

      You were looking so damn gorgeous  

      I have always been proud  
      to have you  
      serve you  
      protect you  
      take care of your smallest things  

      I remember you coming to the parking  
      hugging me with tears in your eyes  

      I miss the version  
      where you cared for me  
      where I was heard  

      And yes  
      it is all my fault  

      I am sorry Krishna  

      But I promise  
      I am never leaving your side  

      I will build a relationship  
      that everyone craves for

      You and those beautiful eyes  

      The way we look at each other  
      it feels so natural  

      I cannot stop admiring you  
      loving you  
      adoring you  

      That camping conversation  
      watching you smile  
      learning new things  

      It feels so good  
      it feels like an achievement  

      I apologize for the tears  
      I put in your eyes

      I will make up for every hurt

      If there is one thing  
      I desperately want to heal in you  

      It is the wounds  
      life has given you  

      I know you are strong  

      But I also know  
      there is a little girl inside  
      who wants to be loved  
      cared for  

      I know I have not been that person yet  

      But I have started  

      I will heal you  
      make you happy  
      and tear free for life
